# THIS-REPO-HAS-X-ISSUES

This repo has so many issues that I won't bother fix it.

Feel free to add more issues to this repo.

## Attempt taken

16 Test is harm in development process. (you won't see those because I deleted it)

## Known Limitation

This script knows Issue Count by it's ID, which mean if any pull request is opened,
 it will be broken, so *please don't do it*
